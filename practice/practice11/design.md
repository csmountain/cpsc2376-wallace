# Carter's Board Game Café Program!

## 1. Specification
This program is a lightweight way for the owner of this local board game café to do the following: 
- Maintain a catalog of board games, including the number of available copies.
- Track which customers have borrowed which games.
- Record when games are returned.

The program involves three main classes: `Game`, `Customer`, and `LendingRecord`. It lets the user list games, see which customers are borrowing the game, and track when the game is due and returned.
